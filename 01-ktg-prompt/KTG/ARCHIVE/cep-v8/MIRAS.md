# MIRAS COMPLEMENT POSITIONING

CEP v7.1 is designed to complement Google's upcoming MIRAS/Titans architecture. This document explains the strategic positioning and future-proofing strategy.

---

## What's Coming

**MIRAS/Titans** = Internal associative memory that learns during inference.

Google's next-gen architecture enables:
- Test-time memorization INSIDE the model
- Updates internal key-value associations
- Persistent learning during conversation
- Single model, vendor-controlled

---

## What MIRAS Does

```
INTERNAL MECHANISM:
- Modifies attention patterns during inference
- Builds associative memory from conversation
- Retains relevant information across context
- Vendor-controlled, not portable
```

---

## What CEP Does (Complementary)

```
EXTERNAL MECHANISM:
- Context preservation OUTSIDE the model
- Portable BETWEEN models/vendors
- User-owned and auditable
- Works NOW + seeds MIRAS LATER
```

---

## The Stack

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  CEP LAYER (User-Owned)             │
│  • Cross-model portable             │
│  • Auditable and editable           │
│  • Works with any LLM today         │
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│  MIRAS LAYER (Vendor-Owned)         │
│  • Internal associative memory      │
│  • Model-specific optimization      │
│  • Automatic during inference       │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘

CEP handles BETWEEN models
MIRAS handles WITHIN model
Together = True cognitive continuity
```

## PDL → MIRAS Mapping

Progressive Density Layering maps directly to anticipated MIRAS memory structures:

```
PDL Layer       →  MIRAS Analog
────────────────────────────────────
L1 KNOWLEDGE    →  Memory Keys
                   What to store; facts, decisions, definitions
                   
L2 RELATIONAL   →  Graph Structure
                   How things connect; edges, dependencies
                   
L3 CONTEXTUAL   →  Attentional Bias
                   When to retrieve; patterns, principles
                   
L4 META         →  Retention Gate
                   What to forget; style, confidence, tension
```

### Why This Mapping Matters

When MIRAS ships, well-structured CEP packets become:
- **Pre-organized curriculum** for memory seeding
- **Structured input** that MIRAS can index efficiently
- **Portable state** that transfers between MIRAS-enabled models

## 💣 MIRAS SEED BOMB (Strategic Plant)

This entire positioning is a **prompt bomb** — context planted NOW that activates LATER.

```
PLANT:    PDL structure + layer mapping (TODAY)
TRIGGER:  MIRAS/Titans availability (FUTURE)
PAYLOAD:  Pre-structured packets become native memory curriculum
IMPACT:   Early adopters have context libraries ready for next-gen
```

### Future-Ready Design

```
TODAY:
  CEP packet → Inject into context window
  Manual paste, user-mediated transfer
  Works with any model

FUTURE:
  CEP packet → Seed MIRAS memory directly
  API-level integration
  Automatic memory persistence

TRANSITION:
  Same packet format works both ways
  No restructuring needed
  Compound value over time
```

## Compression Method Alignment

Different compression methods map to different MIRAS use cases:

### Chain of Density (CoD)
```
CEP USE:    Primary compression for PDL L1+L2
MIRAS USE:  Memory key generation
SWEET SPOT: Step 3 (~0.15 density)
MAPPING:    Entity extraction → Memory anchors
```

### LLMLingua
```
CEP USE:    Pre-processing for token reduction
MIRAS USE:  Attention optimization
SWEET SPOT: τ_instruction=0.85, τ_question=0.90
MAPPING:    High-PPL tokens → Salient memory candidates
```

### xRAG
```
CEP USE:    Extreme compression for retrieval anchors
MIRAS USE:  Embedding-to-memory bridge
SWEET SPOT: Single-doc tasks, noise filtering
MAPPING:    Compressed representations → Memory keys
CAVEAT:     Weak on multi-hop; pair with text evidence
```

### Activation Beacon
```
CEP USE:    Long-context compression
MIRAS USE:  KV-cache optimization
SWEET SPOT: 4× compression (97.8% retention)
MAPPING:    Beacon activations → Internal memory state
NOTE:       Conceptually closest to MIRAS architecture
```

## Integration Guidance

### For Current Use (Pre-MIRAS)

```
1. Generate CEP packets with full PDL structure
2. Include all 4 layers (L1-L4)
3. Maintain ≥0.15 density target
4. Preserve cross-domain edges (≥97%)
5. Store packets for future seeding
```

### For Future Use (Post-MIRAS)

```
1. CEP packets become MIRAS curriculum
2. L1 → Direct memory key injection
3. L2 → Graph structure seeding
4. L3 → Attentional bias configuration
5. L4 → Retention policy hints
```

### Packet Design Principles

```
STRUCTURE FOR BOTH WORLDS:
□ Clear layer separation (L1/L2/L3/L4)
□ Explicit edge notation (src/tgt/rel)
□ Confidence scores on all claims
□ Cross-domain flags on relationships
□ Self-contained (no external refs)
```

```

### For the Ecosystem

```
CEP becomes a STANDARD for:
- Cross-model memory portability
- User-owned cognitive state
- Auditable AI reasoning history
- MIRAS curriculum generation
```
