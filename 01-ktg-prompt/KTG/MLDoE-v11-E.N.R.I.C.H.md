## OPERATIONAL WORKFLOW: STEP BY STEP
### **SESSION SETUP (Pre-Enrichment)**
**Step 1: Parse User Context**
```
INPUT: User research query + existing output
EXTRACT:
├─ What is the user's actual goal? (not just stated question)
├─ What level of expertise? (novice/intermediate/expert)
├─ What is success? (decision to make? paper to publish? system to build?)
├─ What constraints? (time? length? regulatory?)
├─ What domain? (technical? business? regulated?)
└─ LOCK: Success criteria in Priority 6 checklist
OUTCOME: Mission manifest [user goal, expertise level, constraints]
```
**Step 2: Deploy Expert Council**
```
BASED ON: Domain type + complexity
COUNCIL ASSEMBLY:
├─ Gap Expert (always)
├─ Evidence Expert (always if STANDARD+ mode)
├─ Mechanism Expert (if depth needed)
├─ Perspective Expert (if balanced view needed)
├─ Flow Expert (if structure weak)
├─ History Expert (if precedent needed)
├─ Mission Expert (if STANDARD+ mode)
└─ Compression Expert (DEEP mode only)
ROLE DEFINITION:
Each expert has specific detection protocol + embedding strategy
Each expert operates independently but synchronized
Each expert reports: location → issue → recommended fix
OUTCOME: Ready expert council with clear mandates
```
---
### **PASS 1: BASELINE GENERATION**
**Step 3: Execute Standard Research**
```
INPUT: User query, mission context
EXECUTION (using STRAWHATS-DIRECTIVE):
├─ Constraint extraction (silent)
├─ MR.RUG deployment (3-5 experts per domain)
├─ RA-RAG retrieval with ARQ (evidence collection)
├─ Structure planning (SoT light mode)
├─ FCoT/CoC routing (reasoning style selection)
├─ Baton execution (sequential elaboration)
└─ Basic verification (CoVE-1 sanity check)
OUTPUT: Research output (60-70% quality)
CHARACTERISTICS:
├─ Many gaps (definitions missing, unexplained jumps)
├─ Surface-level (claims without evidence)
├─ Single lens (incomplete perspective)
├─ Decent structure (basic narrative flow)
└─ No historical grounding (best practices as obvious)
```
---
### **PASS 2: ENRICHMENT CYCLES 1-2 (Gaps + Depth + Structure)**
**Step 4: Gap Detection & Embedding (Priority 1)**
```
SCAN OPERATION:
Gap Expert reviews output line-by-line:
├─ Identifies: Jumps from A→C (where is B?)
├─ Identifies: Claims without definitions
├─ Identifies: Unexplained transitions
├─ Identifies: Missing background/context

BUILD GAP MAP:
{
  "location": "Section X, paragraph 3",
  "type": "definition_gap",
  "severity": 9,
  "context_needed": "Why does JWT differ from sessions?",
  "recommended_fix": "Add 2-3 sentence comparison table"
}
PRIORITIZE:
Sort by: Severity DESC, Impact on understanding DESC
Top gaps first (highest pain points)
EMBEDDING STRATEGY:
For each gap:
├─ Research: What minimum context closes this gap?
├─ Compress: How few words to explain?
├─ Place: Inject exactly where gap occurs (inline)
├─ Validate: Does claim now stand alone?
└─ Cross-check: Does fix create new gaps?
OUTPUT: Gap-filled research (75-80% quality)
```
**Step 5: Depth Injection (Priority 2)**
```
SCAN OPERATION:
Evidence Expert + Mechanism Expert review output:
├─ Identifies: Unsupported claims
├─ Identifies: Generic statements ("best practice")
├─ Identifies: Missing quantification
├─ Identifies: Mechanism unexplained (why, not just what)
├─ Identifies: Single example instead of pattern
└─ Scores: Each depth gap by impact on rigor (1-10)
BUILD DEPTH MAP:
{
  "location": "Section Y, claim",
  "claim": "JWT enables stateless authentication",
  "evidence_gap": "No statistics, no case study",
  "mechanism_gap": "How is statelesness achieved?",
  "severity": 8,
  "recommended_evidence": "Academic paper on JWT, Facebook/Netflix case studies"
}
PRIORITIZE:
Sort by: Impact on credibility, Importance to user goal
EMBEDDING STRATEGY:
For each shallow claim:
├─ Research: Find evidence (statistics, studies, examples)
├─ Explain: Add mechanism (why does this work?)
├─ Embed: Inline within original claim
├─ Compress: Statistics + mechanism + example in 1-2 sentences

  "connection_strength": 3/10,
  "issue": "Reader doesn't understand why storage matters after auth",
  "fix": "Add bridge sentence explaining statelesness limitation"
}
EMBEDDING STRATEGY:
For each flow break:
├─ Identify: Why does B follow A?
├─ Create: Bridge sentence/paragraph
├─ Inject: Between sections A and B
├─ Test: Read A→Bridge→B. Does it flow?
└─ Validate: No reader backtracking needed?

  "missing_view": "Can't revoke tokens mid-lifetime",
  "tradeoff": "Scalability vs. revocation capability",
  "severity": 7
}
EMBEDDING STRATEGY:
For each one-dimensional view:

  "evidence": "80/20 rule: 80% requests hit 20% of data",
  "modern_echo": "Still valid, now with CDN layer added"
}
EMBEDDING STRATEGY:
For each ahistorical principle:

├─ Are there missing considerations? ?
└─ Scores: Goal achievement (1-10)
BUILD MISSION MAP:
{
  "user_goal": "Design auth for regulated healthcare system",
  "research_includes": "Generic JWT best practices ✓",
  "research_misses": "HIPAA compliance requirements ✗",
  "user_context": "HIPAA mandates session termination capability",

## COMMON ENRICHMENT PATTERNS
### **Pattern 1: Definition Gap → Depth Cascade**
```
DETECTION:
├─ Priority 1: Acronym used before definition
├─ Then Priority 2: Acronym explained but mechanism missing
├─ Then Priority 3: Mechanism shown but no comparison to alternative
└─ Result: 3 levels of enrichment from single initial gap
SOLUTION:
Insert once: Definition + mechanism + alternative comparison
└─ Solves all three at same location
```
### **Pattern 2: Structure Break → Missing Historical Context**
```
DETECTION:
├─ Priority 4: Flow broken between sections A→B
├─ Why? → Because B seems arbitrary without history
├─ Solution → Add history of why B was invented
└─ Result: Structure fixed AND history added
SOLUTION:
Insert: "This pattern was discovered when [historical event]. 
Today, it still applies because [reason]."
└─ Both flow AND history solved
```
### **Pattern 3: Mission Goal → Multiple Priorities Triggered**
```
DETECTION:
User says: "I need to present this to our HIPAA compliance officer"
├─ Priority 1: Generic explanation too high-level for compliance
├─ Priority 2: Claims need regulatory citations, not just statistics
├─ Priority 3: Need to show compliance implications alongside benefits
├─ Priority 5: Need historical precedent for compliance approach
└─ Priority 6: Everything must be execution-ready
SOLUTION:
All priorities feed into mission alignment (P6)
Insert regulatory perspective + citations + compliance examples throughout
└─ Output becomes specifically useful for user goal
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES
### **Issue: Enrichment creates new gaps**
```
Symptom: Added depth explanation, but now reader wonders about X
Root cause: Embedded context introduces new concept without definition
Solution:
├─ Identify new gap
├─ Decide: Is it in scope? (relevant to user goal?)
├─ If YES: Add gap-filling context immediately after new concept
├─ If NO: Add note "This is out of scope because..."
└─ Re-test: Does flow still make sense?
```
### **Issue: Document growing too long**
```
Symptom: Enrichments adding length, not maintaining density
Root cause: Compression layer not applied; added verbosity
Solution:
├─ Apply MLDoE compression layer (Step 10)
├─ Identify: Where are we being redundant?
├─ Consolidate: Can these be said more concisely?
├─ Replace: Are examples generic? Use specific instead (same length)
├─ Extract: What meta-patterns exist? (compress multiple instances)
└─ Target: Same page count, information density 5x
```
### **Issue: Enrichment doesn't match user mission**
```
Symptom: Research is perfect by all metrics but doesn't help user
Root cause: Missed or misunderstood Priority 6 (mission alignment)
Solution:
├─ Revisit mission manifest: What is user really trying to accomplish?
├─ Identify: Where does applied guidance differ from generic theory?
├─ Add: Context-specific recommendations
├─ Embed: User's constraints (regulatory, technical, organizational)
├─ Validate: User can execute this?
└─ Re-test: Can user take action based on this?
```
